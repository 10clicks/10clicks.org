        Dear valued site patron, <br />
        We would like to explain the philosophy behind this project with a short letter. <br /><br />
        Going into our senior year of high school, we were discontent with how we'd spent our three of four years. 
        We'd made good friends and memories but near the end of it we realized the importance of doing what we enjoy, 
        not what we think pads a resume. Together we pitched ideas and with strong success, we found our ideals for a content life. 
        <br />
        Time passed and we decided to create a project to share it. 
        Together we constructed a sort of “to-do list” of tasks which we find best satisfies the requirements for a prosperous well-being. 
        10clicks.org is a digital embodiment of what we think every human needs to feel fulfilled, or at least happy.
        <br /><br />
        Best regards,
        <br />
        Benjamin DeWeese van Schooneveld, Oleksandr Gorpynich.
        <br /><br />
        Below are the listed requisites for happiness.
      </p>
